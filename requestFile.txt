It's 11.49,February 1st 2024.I'm trying to make a PBFT demo with reed-solon algorithm.
From 11.28,February 3rd 2024.I have finished the PBFT demo with reed-solon algorithm.
And did you konw?The project run successfully with RS shards stored in nodes' boltdb.
But I find that rspbft didn't have better performance than pbft.So I'm trying to make it better.
